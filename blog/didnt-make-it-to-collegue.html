                    I recently received my results from my college applications. I'm not sure how it is in other
                    countries, but in Mexico, you have to take a test to get into public college, which is one of
                    the best options there is. I presented my tests to the UNAM and IPN, which are two of the best
                    universities in Mexico.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sadly, and against all odds, I didn't make it to either of them. Seeing the results on my phone at 1
                    a.m. was
                    one of the worst feelings I've ever had. I felt like I had failed my parents, my friends, and most
                    importantly, myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always wanted to enter one of those universities, and I've always been told that I'm smart
                    enough to do it, so
                    I was really confident that I would make it. I was so confident that I didn't even apply to any
                    other university, and it
                    backfired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it was devastating at the moment, it didn't take me long to realize that it wasn't the end of
                    the world.
                    I talked to my parents and I'm very lucky, because they are really supportive. They told me that,
                    even though it was
                    a setback, I could still make it to a good university, and that I could always try again next year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward a few months, I'm already studying to apply again. It isn't easy, but I'm trying my
                    best. When I did my tests the
                    first time, I felt so relieved to finally being able to relax, and knowing that I had to do it all
                    over again really puts
                    a lot of pressure on me. I'm trying to stay positive, and I'm trying to study as much as I can, but
                    it's hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope I can make it this time. I know I will, but I'm still scared. I'm scared of failing again,
                    and I'm scared of disappointing
                    everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm sure not a single soul will read this anytime soon, but if you did, thank you. I just needed to
                    vent a little bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will update this or create another post once I have my new results, but until then, thank you for
                    reading.
